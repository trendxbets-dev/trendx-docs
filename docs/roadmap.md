# Product Roadmap

This roadmap outlines how the platform evolves from an initial MVP into a fully decentralized, community-driven prediction market.

Our approach is intentional: **ship a working product first, then progressively decentralize and expand functionality**.

## **Phase I — Mainnet MVP (Live)**

The MVP is designed to prove the core mechanic, validate user demand, and establish a reliable user experience.

### What’s Included

* Live mainnet deployment
* Real wallet integration
* Real bets and real payouts
* Trend-based prediction markets
* Multiple timeframes
* Transparent payout logic
* Peer-to-peer liquidity model

### Architecture (Important)

* Core execution logic is **off-chain and centralized** in this phase
* This allows:

  * Rapid iteration
  * Fast bug fixes
  * Safe testing of payout mechanics
  * A smoother early user experience

### Why This Approach

In crypto, decentralization is a process — not a checkbox.

The MVP prioritizes:

* **Functionality over theory**
* **Reliability over complexity**
* **Proven mechanics before hard-coding them on-chain**

This mirrors how many successful protocols began: ship first, decentralize responsibly.


## **Phase II — On-Chain Core Logic**

Once the MVP is validated, core components will be progressively moved on-chain.

### Goals

* Reduce trust assumptions
* Increase transparency
* Make settlement and liquidity verifiable on-chain

### Expected Upgrades

* On-chain escrow for user stakes
* On-chain pool accounting
* On-chain or hybrid settlement logic
* Clear, auditable market outcomes

This phase transitions the platform from a **functional system** to a **trust-minimized protocol**.


## **Phase III — Governance & DAO Layer**

With a stable on-chain foundation, governance is introduced.

### Governance Scope

* Community voting on which trends are listed
* Curation of markets and categories
* Signaling on platform parameters
* Progressive decentralization of decision-making

### Philosophy

Governance is introduced **after** the product works — not before.

This ensures:

* Voting has real impact
* Participants understand what they are governing
* The system avoids premature decentralization


## **Phase IV — Peer-to-Peer Markets**

The final phase expands the platform beyond standardized markets.

### What This Unlocks

* User-created markets
* Custom timeframes and conditions
* Private or invite-only bets
* Creator-driven market incentives

This module transforms the platform from a single-product system into a **flexible market creation framework**.


## **Long-Term Vision**

Each phase builds on the previous one:

1. **Prove the mechanic**
2. **Decentralize the core**
3. **Hand governance to the community**
4. **Unlock full peer-to-peer creation**

The roadmap is designed to scale sustainably while preserving security, fairness, and transparency at every step.


## **Final Note**

Timelines are intentionally flexible.

Progression between phases is driven by:

* Stability
* Usage
* Community feedback
* Technical readiness

This ensures each upgrade strengthens the platform rather than introducing unnecessary risk.
