# What is TrendsX Bets?


TrendsX Bets is a real-time attention prediction platform - a market where users bet on the movement of public interest.


Instead of trading prices, tokens, or hype, users speculate on what the world will care about next, using live Google Trends data as the foundation.


Each bet represents a measurable belief about collective curiosity... a conviction backed by data, not speculation.


“Put your money where your mouth is.”


## Core Concept


**TrendsX Bets = Polymarket × Google Trends - Onchain**

It’s a new class of speculative platform that merges:

**Google Trends data** (real search interest)

**Crypto-style betting mechanics**

**Wallet-based participation (Phantom / Solana)**

Users can:

Select a trending topic (e.g., “Bitcoin,” “AI Girlfriends,” “Quantum Breakthrough”, "Hyperinflation")

Predict whether its search interest will rise or fall

Place a bet using crypto

Track outcomes via real-time charts


Each prediction is powered by actual, measurable human behavior - search volume data; making this the first truly on-chain data-native betting platform.


## Why TrendsX Exists

The crypto market has become saturated with noise - meme coins, manipulative price action, and speculative assets that reflect hype, not reality.

But beneath all that chaos lies a deeper truth:

**Attention drives markets.**

When millions of people start searching for a topic, narratives form, capital follows, and value shifts.

TrendsX Bets captures that attention flow at its source, letting users bet directly on curiosity itself — before price moves.


## The Problem with Meme Markets
