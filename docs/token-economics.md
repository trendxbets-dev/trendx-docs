## What is $TRENDX?

$TRENDX is the native token of the TrendsX Bets ecosystem - the first market built entirely on human attention.

It represents conviction, governance, and access.
Rather than being another speculative meme coin, $TRENDX is the economic backbone of a system that rewards belief, accuracy, and participation.

“Attention is the asset. Conviction is the currency.”


## Token Philosophy


**1. Utility, Not Hype**

$TRENDX exists to power the market, not to replace it.
Its demand comes from actual use - leverage access, staking, governance, and rewards.

**2. Conviction-as-Value** 

The token measures how strongly users believe in their own insights.
Holding or staking $TRENDX amplifies influence, leverage, and governance power.

**3. Fair, Transparent, Sustainable**

No artificial pumps. No hidden insiders.
Value accrues through participation, not speculation.
