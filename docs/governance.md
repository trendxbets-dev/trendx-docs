## What is the TrendX DAO?

The TrendX DAO is the collective intelligence layer of the platform - the mechanism through which users curate, evolve, and steer the global attention market.

It ensures that the system reflects what people actually care about, not what a centralized team decides.

Every user holding or staking $TRENDX becomes part of the DAO, with the ability to propose, vote, and influence the evolution of the attention economy.

“The crowd curates the crowd’s curiosity.”


## Why Governance Matters

In a world where attention changes by the minute, governance must be dynamic, democratic, and data-aware.

Traditional platforms are centralized — one team decides what’s trending.
TrendX flips that power structure: the people who bet on attention get to decide what attention is worth betting on.

The DAO prevents:

Centralized bias in topic selection

Stale or irrelevant trend listings

Manipulation by external actors

And it promotes:

Real-time market responsiveness

Decentralized curation

Incentivized community participation


## Governance Structure Overview

Layer Role Description

**$TRENDX Token Holders**

Core voters

Propose, discuss, and vote on governance items

**Stakers / High Conviction Users**

Weighted voters

Earn additional voting power for long-term staking

**DAO Council (Optional)**

Facilitators

Maintain proposal quality, prevent spam, and handle emergencies

**Community Contributors**

Builders / Marketers

Submit new trend ideas, campaigns, and research

Governance is open but weighted by conviction — the more you participate and stake, the stronger your voice.


## Governance Actions

Action TypeDescription

Add Trend

Propose a new keyword, topic, or category to list on the main dashboard.

Delist Trend

Vote to remove trends with low activity or engagement.

Adjust Parameters

Suggest changes to fees, leverage limits, or timeframes.

Feature Trends

Highlight specific trends for short-term boosts or campaigns.

Allocate Treasury

Propose how the DAO’s funds are used for development, marketing, or partnerships.

Each action passes through a proposal → discussion → vote → execution pipeline.


## The Trend Lifecycle

The DAO manages the flow of topics in and out of the platform.

**1. Proposal**

Any user can submit a proposal to list a new trend:

Example: “Quantum Computing,” “TikTok Ban,” or “World War 3.”

Proposal includes data snapshot (Google Trends proof) and rationale.

**2. Voting**

$TRENDX holders vote:

YES to add

NO to reject

Votes are weighted by:

$TRENDX holdings

Conviction Score (accuracy + consistency metric)

**3. Activation**

Approved trends are added to the public list and enter the live betting pool.

**4. Lifecycle Rotation**

If a trend’s volume falls below a minimum threshold → it’s flagged for delisting.

DAO votes on removal or replacement.

“The market breathes — old trends fade, new ones rise.”


## Voting Power Calculation

Voting power isn’t just based on tokens — it’s based on conviction.

**Formula (conceptual):**

Voting Power = ($TRENDX held × Holding Duration Weight) + Conviction Score

FactorDescription

**$TRENDX held**

Basic weight of ownership

**Holding Duration**

Rewards long-term holders

**Conviction Score**

Adds influence for accurate, consistent predictors

**Staking Multiplier**

Bonus for locked positions

This hybrid model prevents whales from dominating and rewards accuracy + engagement equally.

## Treasury & Rewards

The DAO Treasury is funded by:

A small percentage of betting fees (in SOL or $TRENDX)

Burned tokens redirected from inactive wallets

Partnerships and ecosystem collaborations

**Treasury Use Cases:**

Ecosystem growth grants

Marketing and reward programs

Development bounties

Token buybacks or burns (via DAO vote)

Treasury spending proposals must pass majority DAO approval.


## Incentives for Participation

ActivityReward

**Submit a valid proposal**

$TRENDX reward

**Vote on proposals**

Staking yield boost

**Accurate predictions**

Conviction Score bonus

**Community moderation**

Reputation rewards

**Top voter leaderboard**

DAO recognition & special access

The DAO turns participation into a game of influence, where every meaningful action adds weight to your voice.


## Governance Security Model

**Smart Contract Safeguards:** DAO contracts include a delay system to prevent malicious or rushed executions.

**Emergency Council (optional):** temporary human oversight in early stages, replaced by full decentralization later.

**Multi-sig Treasury:** managed by trusted DAO signers until governance stabilizes.

Transparency Dashboard: every transaction and vote viewable on-chain.


## Governance Roadmap

PhaseDescription

**Phase 1 – Advisory DAO**

Limited proposal system; team oversight; early voting.

**Phase 2 – Community DAO**

Token-weighted voting and Conviction Scores active.

**Phase 3 – Full Autonomy**

DAO manages trend lifecycle, treasury, and future feature proposals.

**Phase 4 – Meta-Governance**

TrendX DAO interacts with external DAOs for cross-ecosystem attention markets.


## Summary

TrendX DAO is not just a governance layer —
it’s a living, breathing curation engine for the internet’s attention.

Powered by $TRENDX and guided by conviction,
it ensures that what’s traded on the platform is what truly matters to the world.

The people decide what the world is paying attention to —
and they get rewarded for getting it right.
